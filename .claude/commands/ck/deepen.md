description: Spare-budget design pass. Make one shallow module deep — smaller interface, behavior held, tests green before & after.
argument-hint: [module/path | "improve the design"]
---

Invoke the **deepen** skill (`skills/deepen/SKILL.md`). Pick the single shallowest
module the spec touches, diagnose the design defect at file:line, research a
deeper shape (hand the external case to research → §R), and propose §I/§V/§T edits
to spec. Behavior is sacred — full suite green before AND after. Run only when the
build is green and there is token budget to drain.
